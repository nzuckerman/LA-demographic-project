# LA-demographic-project
This was a project I did in AP Stats comparing mean elevation and median household income among census tracts in Los Angeles county. 
This tool shows the regression line for a subset of counties in LA to look at regional differences in the relationship between elevation and income. 
Here is a link to the presentation slideshow that explains more about it: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P8tJc4N6cHxnem90kYHgeFGcuSp15aZY8Gl5ClMGCMM/edit#slide=id.p)https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P8tJc4N6cHxnem90kYHgeFGcuSp15aZY8Gl5ClMGCMM/edit#slide=id.p
